The previous AI engineer initiated work on a full-stack application, evolving it from a basic MVP. The primary task started with improving PDF generation quality, specifically fixing Turkish character display and integrating the Montserrat font. This involved significant modifications to the backend's  class. Debugging revealed missing environment variables and font rendering issues, which were systematically resolved with the help of a .

Following this, extensive PDF customization requests were handled, including logo integration, dynamic date calculations, table column modifications, color scheme adjustments, and detailed footer information. A major feature, labor cost input for quotes, was introduced and iteratively refined for both backend calculation and frontend UI/UX, including updating existing quotes. Further UX enhancements addressed minor issues like a Kategorsiz typo and implemented toggle functionality for displaying discounted prices in both product and quote views, defaulting to hidden. A significant feature for bulk product category assignment, requiring a new backend PUT endpoint, was also successfully implemented. The engineer is currently working on a streamlined quote creation process directly from the products view. A user query about site performance is pending.

<product_requirements>
The initial product requirement was to enhance the PDF download quality, specifically addressing poor rendering of Turkish characters and integrating the Montserrat font according to a provided design. This expanded to a comprehensive PDF layout redesign, including:
- Replacing the main header with Çorlu Karavan and a provided logo.
- Setting the quote's start date to the creation date and the end date to 7 days thereafter.
- Removing the Marka column from the product table within the PDF.
- Standardizing the color of Net Toplam and Önemli Notlar texts.
- Modifying specific text in the Önemli Notlar section (removing fiyatlara kdv dahildir., updating montaj ve nakliye, removing teknik destek) and updating contact emails.
- Further design refinements included a new logo, adjusting the Net Toplam font size, and adopting a new color palette (#2F4B68 for main texts, #A6C9EC for table headers).

A key feature was the introduction of a manual labor cost input for quotes, which needed to:
- Be included in total calculations and displayed in the PDF.
- Have a user-friendly frontend UI with preset buttons and live updates.
- Allow users to update *existing* quotes with labor costs, not just create new ones.

Additional UI/UX improvements included:
- Adding a green tick/Enter key handler to apply labor costs.
- Ensuring PDF downloads use the actual quote name, not Geçici Teklif.
- Displaying labor costs within quote list cards.
- Adding toggle buttons to show/hide discounted prices in both product listing and quote summary sections, with a default hidden state.
- Implementing a bulk product assignment feature in the Kategoriler section, allowing users to select unassigned products and add them to a category.
The current task is to enable quick quote creation directly from the product selection page, prompting for a customer name. A performance concern regarding site slowness has also been raised.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Full-stack Architecture:** React for frontend, FastAPI for backend, MongoDB for data storage.
-   **PDF Generation:** Python's  library is used in the backend, with custom classes for styling and content.
-   **State Management:** React  and  hooks for managing UI state and component lifecycle.
-   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS for a responsive and modern user interface.
-   **API Design:** RESTful principles for backend API endpoints, using Pydantic for data validation.
-   **Environment Variables:** Secure configuration via  files and .

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard full-stack architecture:


-   ****:
    -   **Importance:** This file contains the FastAPI application, defining all API routes (), MongoDB interactions, and the core business logic, including complex PDF generation.
    -   **Summary of Changes:**
        -   **PDF Generation:** The  class was extensively refactored. This involved integrating custom fonts (Montserrat), enhancing Turkish character support, incorporating a new logo, applying specific brand colors, and updating the layout for company details, product tables, total summaries, and footer information (e.g., contact details, specific notes, dynamic date range).
        -   **Data Models:**  and  Pydantic models were updated to include fields like  and  to support new quote functionalities.  was introduced implicitly for category assignments.
        -   **API Endpoints:**
            -   A new  endpoint was added to enable updating existing quotes, specifically for  and .
            -   A  endpoint was added to allow updating individual product details, crucially for assigning .
        -   **Environment:** Code was adjusted to correctly load  from the environment, addressing a startup .

-   ****:
    -   **Importance:** This is the primary React component, managing the entire user interface, application state, and orchestrating interactions with the backend API.
    -   **Summary of Changes:**
        -   **PDF Workflow:** The UI for generating PDFs was revamped, including dynamic button labels (PDF İndir vs. İşçilikli PDF İndir) based on  and removing the Resmi Teklif Oluştur button and its associated dialog.
        -   **Labor Cost UI:**  state, input fields, preset buttons (₺500, ₺1000, etc.), live calculation updates, and a green tick/Enter key integration for applying labor costs were added. Labor cost is now displayed in the quote summary and in each quote card in the list.
        -   **Quote Management:** A  state was added to track the currently loaded quote, enabling updates to existing quotes via the new backend PUT endpoint. A Teklifi Kaydet (Save Quote) button was introduced, appearing conditionally when changes (discount/labor) are made.
        -   **Discount Display Toggle:**  and  states (defaulting to ) were added with corresponding Eye/EyeOff icons () to control the visibility of discounted price columns in both product and quote views.
        -   **Category Management:** States (, , , ) and UI components (an Ürün Ekle button on category cards, a dialog for selecting unassigned products with checkboxes, and logic for bulk assignment) were added to allow adding multiple unassigned products to a category.
        -   **Typo Correction:** Multiple instances of Kategorsiz were corrected to Kategorisiz.
        -   **Quick Quote Creation (In-progress):** New states (, ), a  function skeleton, a Teklif Oluştur button in the products section, and an associated  for capturing the customer name have been added.

-   ** and **:
    -   **Importance:** These files store environment-specific variables crucial for the application's operation.

<pending_tasks>
-   **Performance Optimization:** Investigate and address the user's concern about site slowness, determining if it's related to the preview environment or if broader optimizations are needed.
-   **Complete Quick Quote Creation:** Finish the implementation of the Teklif Oluştur feature in the products section, including integrating customer name input and saving the new quote.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
The AI engineer is actively working on implementing a quick quote creation feature directly within the product listing section. This functionality aims to streamline the process of generating a quote after selecting products, by prompting for a customer name and then saving the quote.

Specifically, the following progress has been made in :
-   **State Management:** Two new React states have been introduced:  (a boolean to control the visibility of the quote creation dialog) and  (a string to store the customer's name input).
-   **Quick Quote Functionality:** A placeholder function named  has been defined. This function is intended to encapsulate the logic for taking the selected products and the provided customer name, creating a new quote object, and sending it to the backend for persistence.
-   **UI Integration:** A Teklif Oluştur (Create Quote) button has been added to the products tab. This button is positioned next to the Seçimi Temizle button and is expected to become visible when products are selected.
-   **Customer Name Dialog:** A  component, , has been added to the application's structure. This dialog is designed to open when the Teklif Oluştur button is clicked and will contain an input field for the user to enter the customer's name before the quote is finalized.

The current state is that the dialog component for capturing the customer name has been added, and the necessary states and the  function are in place. The next logical step involves fully integrating the input field within this dialog and connecting it to the  function to complete the feature's functionality.
