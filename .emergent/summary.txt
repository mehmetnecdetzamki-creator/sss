The AI engineer successfully implemented several features and resolved critical bugs in a full-stack React/FastAPI/MongoDB application. Initially, the Üzerine Tamamla (rounding) feature was completely removed from both products and quotes sections, followed by backend testing. Next, decimal display was enabled exclusively for exchange rates while keeping product prices as integers. Significant performance optimizations were then introduced, including backend pagination, product count endpoint, MongoDB indexing, frontend pagination states, Load More button for infinite scroll, search debounce, React memoization, and GZip compression.

Subsequently, the AI engineer addressed a user request to display all products with a search bar in the category product addition dialog, while retaining pagination in the main products view. This led to a critical bug fix for product selection persistence across search and pagination in the quote creation process. UI refinements included renaming a Yükle button to Teklifi Önizle and removing a redundant one. A complex issue of quote editing (overwriting existing quotes instead of creating new ones) was then tackled, involving multiple debugging cycles, a  call, and a crucial fix for React Map state updates and correct quantity loading.

Further enhancements included adding a feature to clear labor cost via a green checkmark button and implementing WhatsApp PDF sharing functionality from both the quotes list and the editing interface. This WhatsApp feature underwent several iterations to support automatic PDF download, manual attachment instructions, new tab opening, no message content, and robust device-specific handling (mobile app vs. web). Finally, mobile responsive design issues for menus and buttons were resolved. The last ongoing task involves migrating MongoDB data to Atlas, which encountered SSL/TLS issues and is currently progressing through JSON file export for manual import, with the user requesting a web link for large files.

<product_requirements>
The user provided a series of explicit requests to enhance and fix the existing quote/price management application. These can be summarized as follows:

1.  **Remove Üzerine Tamamla Feature:** Completely remove the complete/round-up section, specifically a function that rounded up offer amounts for labor cost calculation.
2.  **Decimal Display for Exchange Rates:** Show decimal places only for currency exchange rates, while product prices should continue to be displayed as whole numbers.
3.  **Performance Optimizations for Large Datasets:** Implement necessary optimizations to handle 2500-3000 products without lag or freezing, especially for hosting on a Raspberry Pi. This implicitly includes pagination, efficient data loading, and potentially caching/compression.
4.  **Category Product Addition Enhancements:** In the category product addition dialog, all products should be displayed (no pagination), and a search bar should be available. The main product listing should retain its 50-product pagination.
5.  **Product Selection Persistence Fix:** Resolve a bug where selecting a product from a search result, then clearing the search and searching for another product, causes previously selected items to disappear from the quote.
6.  **Quote Button Refinement:** In the Teklifler (Quotes) section, remove a redundant Yükle (Load) button (without an icon) and rename the remaining icon-bearing Yükle button to Teklifi Önizle (Preview Quote).
7.  **Quote Editing Functionality:** When previewing and editing an existing quote (changing labor cost or adding/removing products) with the same name, saving should update the existing quote, not create a new one.
8.  **Clear Labor Cost:** Add functionality to clear the labor cost input by clicking a green checkmark icon that appears next to it.
9.  **WhatsApp PDF Sharing (from Quotes List):** Add an option to send the quote as a PDF via WhatsApp from the quotes list. It should open the WhatsApp application on mobile and WhatsApp Web on desktop.
10. **WhatsApp PDF Sharing (from Quote Preview):** Extend the WhatsApp PDF sharing functionality to the quote editing/preview interface as well.
11. **Direct PDF File Sharing via WhatsApp:** Modify the WhatsApp sharing to send the PDF as a direct file attachment rather than a link. (Later clarified to be an automatic download with manual attachment instructions due to API limitations).
12. **WhatsApp Sharing Bug Fixes:**
    *   Ensure WhatsApp Web opens in a new tab, not redirecting the current tab.
    *   Ensure the WhatsApp message content is empty (no pre-filled text).
    *   Fix mobile (Android) not opening the WhatsApp application, instead redirecting to the browser.
13. **Mobile Responsive Design:** Fix UI issues on mobile browsers where menus (Products, Quotes tabs) overlap and quote action buttons (Preview, Download, WhatsApp) are displaced or squeezed.
14. **MongoDB Atlas Migration:** Migrate the existing local MongoDB data to MongoDB Atlas.

The AI engineer has successfully implemented most of these features and fixed numerous bugs related to them, with the last ongoing task being the MongoDB Atlas migration.

<pending_tasks>
-   **MongoDB Atlas Migration Completion:** The JSON files for the local MongoDB database have been exported. The user still needs to import these files into MongoDB Atlas, particularly the large , , and .
-   **Frontend Integration of Atlas:** Once the data is migrated, the  in  will need to be updated to point to the new MongoDB Atlas connection string, and the application will need to be restarted and tested with the new database.

<current_work>
The AI engineer was most recently working on the MongoDB Atlas migration. Due to persistent SSL/TLS connection issues from the container to MongoDB Atlas, a direct programmatic or  approach failed. The strategy shifted to exporting all local MongoDB data into individual JSON files.

All 6 collections (, , , , , ) were successfully exported into their respective JSON files using . The AI engineer provided the content for the three smaller JSON files (, , ) directly in the chat, along with instructions for importing them into MongoDB Compass. For the three larger files (, , ), the user requested a web link for download. The AI engineer attempted to set up a temporary download service, which failed. The last action was to successfully create an  file within a  directory, presumably to serve as part of a new attempt to provide these large files via a web link. The current state is that the JSON files exist locally in the container, but the user has not yet received a working method to download the larger files for import into Atlas.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
Provide the web link for downloading the large JSON files to the user for MongoDB Atlas import.
