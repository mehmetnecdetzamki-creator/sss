The previous AI engineer initiated development based on a series of feature requests for a full-stack React/FastAPI/MongoDB application. The work began by implementing a Favorite Products feature, including backend API modifications and frontend UI updates with sorting. Subsequently, the engineer addressed UI/UX refinements such as fixing table column alignment, adding product name truncation, and relocating a discounted price toggle icon to all categories. A major Packages feature was then introduced, encompassing backend CRUD operations, a dedicated frontend tab, full-page editing for packages, and PDF export functionalities. The PDF generation was refined to match existing templates, remove descriptions, and reposition the date. Most recently, a Sarf Malzemeleri (Consumables/Supplies) system was integrated into packages, allowing for cost tracking without customer visibility. The latest efforts involve creating a dedicated, non-deletable category for supplies, filtering products in the supply section by this category, and adding quantity/deletion options for existing supplies. The current state has backend startup issues related to uvicorn imports and a duplicate startup event, which is the immediate focus.

<product_requirements>
The user initially requested a Favorite Products feature, allowing users to mark products with a star and sort product listings to show favorites first. UI/UX improvements followed, including fixing table column misalignment and truncation for long product names, and relocating a discounted prices eye icon to appear consistently across all categories, to the left of the product count.

A significant feature, Packages, was then requested. This feature allows users to create named packages with selected products, assign a custom sale price (independent of product list prices), add an image URL, and view a calculated total of discounted prices via an eye icon. The package editing experience was later refined to be a full-page view, not a pop-up, displaying selected products with categories and a search bar. PDF export for packages was added, offering two formats: one with only product names (using the custom sale price) and another with product names and their list prices (summing to an automatic total). These PDFs needed to use the existing quote template, exclude descriptions, and display the date in the top-right corner.

The latest feature request is a Sarf Malzemeleri (Consumables/Supplies) system within packages. This involves creating a special, non-deletable Sarf Malzemeleri category, filtering the products selectable as supplies to only those from this category, adding a search option for supplies, and enabling quantity modification and deletion for existing supplies within a package. These supplies should contribute to the package's total cost (visible via the eye icon) but remain hidden from customer-facing PDFs.

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard full-stack architecture:


-   **/app/backend/server.py**: This is the core of the FastAPI backend.
    -   **Importance**: Defines all API endpoints, MongoDB models (Product, Category, UploadHistory, Package, PackageProduct, PackageSupply), and business logic. It handles data retrieval, manipulation, and PDF generation.
    -   **Changes Made**:
        -   Added  field to  model.
        -   Added ,  API endpoints.
        -   Introduced , , ,  models.
        -   Implemented CRUD endpoints for packages (, , , , ).
        -   Added , , ,  endpoints for package content management.
        -   Integrated PDF generation logic (, , ) reusing elements from .
        -   Modified  to potentially include a non-deletable flag.
        -   Added a specific endpoint for retrieving Sarf Malzemeleri products only.
        -   Refined PDF layout for date and description.
        -   Introduced  field to  model and updated  logic.
        -   Added startup event to create Sarf Malzemeleri category.

-   **/app/frontend/src/App.js**: The main React component for the frontend.
    -   **Importance**: Manages all frontend state, renders UI components, and handles API interactions with the backend. It orchestrates the user experience across different tabs and features.
    -   **Changes Made**:
        -   Added ,  functions.
        -   Updated product listing to show favorite status and allow toggling.
        -   Added a Favori Ürünler card in the categories section.
        -   Implemented table column fixes (fixed width, truncation for product names) for better alignment.
        -   Moved the discounted price eye icon to appear in every category header.
        -   Added a Packages tab between Quotes and Companies.
        -   Implemented package management states (, , , , , , , ).
        -   Created functions for package CRUD and product/supply management within packages.
        -   Replaced package creation/editing modals with a full-page conditional rendering approach.
        -   Integrated categorized product listing with search functionality for adding products/supplies to packages.
        -   Added PDF download buttons to the package edit page.
        -   Added UI for adding and managing supplies within a package, including search, quantity, and delete options.
        -   Resolved various syntax errors and rendering issues during development.

-   **/app/backend/.env**: New file created to store .
    -   **Importance**: Crucial for backend database connectivity, ensures flexible deployment without hardcoding sensitive information.
    -   **Changes Made**: Created and added  and .

-   **/app/frontend/.env**: Stores frontend environment variables.
    -   **Importance**: Provides the backend URL to the React application, critical for API calls.
    -   **Changes Made**: Updated  for preview environment.

<pending_tasks>
-   **Frontend Package Editing Issue**: The package editing page sometimes fails to open on button click (related to  state or click handler).
-   **Backend Startup Error (Uvicorn)**: There's an  import error and a potential duplicate startup event preventing the backend from starting correctly.
-   **Sarf Malzemeleri Category Creation**: The Sarf Malzemeleri category is not being created on backend startup as intended.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was implementing the Sarf Malzemeleri (Consumables/Supplies) feature. This involved creating a dedicated, non-deletable Sarf Malzemeleri category, filtering product selection for supplies by this category, and adding search, quantity modification, and deletion options for supplies within a package's edit page.

The work involved modifying  to add  to the  model, updating category deletion logic, and adding a new endpoint  to fetch only products from the Sarf Malzemeleri category. The startup event was also updated to create this special category. On the frontend,  was updated to include state for supply search, load supply-specific products, integrate search and categorized listing for supplies, and add UI elements for managing existing supplies (quantity, delete buttons).

The last reported issue is a backend startup error ( import error and possible duplicate startup event), indicated by logs in Chat 616, preventing the new Sarf Malzemeleri category from being created and the backend from functioning.

I will investigate and fix the  import error and duplicate startup event in .
